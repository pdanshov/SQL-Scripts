Thanks for the help.. 

Just in case the need ever arises, here's how I had to structure the SQL for
the procedure calls that returned variables:

EXEC MAD.dbo.trvsp_NextTransId 'INTRANS', 1, @TransID Out 

became

SET @sql1 = @CompId + '.dbo.trvsp_NextTransId '
exec @sql1 'INTRANS', 1, @TransID Out

Note if you comnmand contains '
I thing you have to use ''''



declare @x varchar(255)
set @x=(select substring(db_name(),1,3)) + '.dbo.Utility_RefreshViews'
exec @x



this was in a database named XXXTranslate and I wanted it to write to
traverse comany XXX



declare @x varchar(255)
set @x='XXX.dbo.Utility_RefreshViews'
set @x=replace(@x,'XXX',@YourVar)
exec @x
